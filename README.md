# NavPath

## Overview
This project provides an intelligent ship navigation system that optimizes routes based on:
- Weather conditions (wind, currents)
- Oceanographic data
- Ship-specific parameters (cargo/passenger)
- Custom optimization criteria (fuel efficiency, speed, comfort)

The system combines A* pathfinding with machine learning heuristics to generate optimal maritime routes.

## Key Features
- **Multi-criteria Optimization**: Choose between fuel efficiency, speed, or passenger comfort
- **Real-time Weather Integration**: Uses wind and current data for dynamic routing
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Click-to-select start/end points with visualization
- **Advanced Heuristics**: Machine learning models for route optimization
- **Support for Different Vessel Types**: Custom parameters for cargo and passenger ships
